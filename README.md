# JAVA-Programming
This repo is about some commonly used java code, like searching, sorting, nested loops, nested switch cases and everything else.
In this repo I will also cover the conpets of Recursion, Dynamic Programming and common Data Structures like Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Linked List.
It will be mostly code examples with less theory.
